Whoever claims the "One Piece" will be named the new pirate king. Monkey D. Luffy, a boy who consumed one of the "Devil\'s Fruits", has it in his head that he\'ll follow in the footsteps of his idol, the pirate Shanks, and find the One Piece. It helps, of course, that his body has the properties of rubber and he\'s surrounded by a bevy of skilled fighters and thieves to help him along the way. Monkey D. Luffy brings a bunch of his crew followed by, Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Tony-Tony Chopper, Nico Robin, Franky, and Brook. They will do anything to get the One Piece and become King of the Pirates!',

Our team must find a way to return all the anachronisms to their original timelines before the time stream falls apart. But before our Legends can jump back into action, Rip Hunter and his newly established Time Bureau call their methods into question and disband the team. Challenging the Time Bureau’s authority, they recruit a hacker from the future, Zari Tomaz and continue their time travelling shenanigans, while insisting that however messy their methods may be, some problems are beyond the Bureau’s capabilities.

He also has a grudge against NCIS, as his son wouldn't have been on the ship if they had not transferred him.\n\nManaging to get a hold of powerful explosives, Dearing started firebombing Navy ships. However, towards the end of the season, Dearing stepped up his game: he had Director Vance abducted. Whilst NCIS found him quickly, it transpired that Dearing was only after Vance for his car, managing to rig up explosives in the car seat so that Vance would unknowingly deliver a car bomb to the Navy Yard. By the time Gibbs realized, it was nearly too late; the bomb detonated, resulting in major damage to the NCIS building, as well as many deaths and injuries and leaving the fates of Gibbs, Tony, McGee, Abby, Ziva and Vance unknown. Upon learning of the destruction, Ducky suffered a heart attack on the beaches of Miami. The finale aired on May 15, 2012.",

Leon Vance and Ziva David soon discover that Mossad Deputy Director Ilan Bodnar was behind the attack, and set out for revenge. They track Bodnar to Berlin, but later learn that he had never left the United States. Going against orders from the Department of Homeland Security, Ziva finds Bodnar on a ship headed for South Africa and kills him. This sparks a massive investigation by the Department of Defense, headed by Richard Parsons. His sneaky and unprofessional methods cause the team to question his true intentions. Everyone soon realizes that he is not interested in Ziva or Vance, but has instead set his sights on Gibbs. Parsons pressures Gibbs to admit that he and his team have broken the law on countless occasions and to come forward and admit everything that he has done. After a long feud, Gibbs is freed of his charges and sent on a top-priority mission, while Ziva, DiNozzo, and McGee resign from the agency. The season ends with a cut to four months later, showing Gibbs aiming a sniper rifle at FBI agent Tobias Fornell. The season finale aired on May 14, 2013.',

      overview:
        "Meliodas begins beating Fraudrin, and Meliodas reveals Fraudrin was never given the Commandment of Selflessness by the Demon King; he was only a temporary replacement. Fraudrin turns himself into a magical bomb to destroy Liones, but he sees Dreyfus holding his son, Griamore, and remembers how he had to pretend to be Griamore’s father and realises he actually cares about him. Griamore grabs Fraudrin and traps them both inside a barrier spell so only they would be killed. Fraudrin finally realises what Selflessness truly means and deactivates the bomb. He then commits suicide by allowing Meliodas to kill him. Merlin explains that each time Meliodas dies, his revival is fuelled by consuming his emotions, meaning the more times he dies the closer he comes to becoming a demon again, as proven by the way he enjoyed killing Fraudrin. Emotional funerals are held for the murdered Holy Knights while Meliodas visits the ruins of the Boar Hat. There he cries as he admits to Elizabeth he enjoyed murdering Fraudrin but found he couldn’t look Ban in the eye. He also admits he is afraid of becoming a demon again even though it might be necessary if he is to continue keeping Elizabeth safe from the Commandments. Merlin restores the destroyed city, and also reveals that all the humans enslaved by Zeldris’ Piety Commandment are all moving South to Camelot. Ban reveals that Elaine is still alive. Merlin reasons that Zeldris and Melascula must both still be alive along with Drole, Gloxinia and Estarossa. As Jericho grieves for her brother, she realises she has inherited his ice magic and decides to become a Holy Knight more powerful than her brother. The King orders Gowther released from prison, and he begins calling himself both the Goat's Sin of Lust and the Commandment of Selflessness. Meliodas decides all of the Seven Deadly Sins must go to war together, and Elizabeth promises to always stay by his side.",

          'The thirteenth season of South Park, an American animated television comedy series, originally aired in the United States on Comedy Central between March 11 and November 18, 2009. The season was headed by the series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who served as executive producers along with Anne Garefino. The season continued to focus on the exploits of protagonists Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Butters in the fictional Colorado mountain town of South Park.\n\nThe season was the first of three new seasons Parker and Stone agreed to produce for the network under a renewal deal. It consisted of fourteen 22-minute episodes, which aired in two groups of seven episodes separated by a six-month gap. Prior to the season\'s premiere, all South Park episodes were made available for free viewing on the official series website, South Park Studios. The 13th season was the first to be broadcast in high definition and in widescreen. Continuing their practice from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within the week before its broadcast date.\n\nThe 13th season satirized such topics as the ACORN scandal, Japanese whaling, piracy in Somalia and the marketing tactics of the Walt Disney Company. Celebrities were spoofed throughout the season, including the Jonas Brothers, Kanye West, Carlos Mencia, Paul Watson and Glenn Beck, all of whom publicly responded to their portrayals. The episode "Fishsticks" attracted particular media attention due to rapper Kanye West\'s declaration that its jokes about his arrogance were funny but hurt his feelings. "The F Word", in which the central characters attempt to change the definition of the word "fag", was especially controversial and prompted complaints from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. A broadcast of "Pinewood Derby" in Mexico was pulled, allegedly due to its depiction of Mexican President Felipe Calderón. "Fatbeard" was praised by the crew of the USS Bainbridge, which was involved in the 2009 rescue of the MV Maersk Alabama from Somali pirates.',

As humans who have undergone surgery in order to make use of the special abilities of ghouls, they participate in operations to eradicate the dangerous creatures. The leader of this group, Haise Sasaki, is a half-ghoul, half-human who has been trained by famed special class investigator, Kishou Arima.

In fact, he’s too strong—even his mightiest opponents are taken out with a single punch, and it turns out that being devastatingly powerful is actually kind of a bore. With his passion for being a hero lost along with his hair, yet still faced with new enemies every day, how much longer can he keep it going?',

          "The first season of the American television medical drama Grey's Anatomy, began airing in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company on March 27, 2005 and concluded on May 22, 2005. The first season introduces the main character, Meredith Grey, as she enrolls in Seattle Grace Hospital's internship program and faces unexpected challenges and surprises. Season one had nine series regulars, six of whom have been part of the main cast ever since. The season initially served as a mid-season replacement for the legal drama Boston Legal, airing in the Sunday night time slot at 10:00, after Desperate Housewives. Although no clip shows have been produced for this season, the events that occur are recapped in \"Straight to Heart\", a clip-show which aired one week before the winter holiday hiatus of the second season ended. The season was officially released on DVD as two-disc Region 1 box set under the title of Grey's Anatomy: Season One on February 14, 2006 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.\n\nThe season's reviews and critiques were generally positive, and the series received several awards and nominations for the cast and crew. The first five episodes of the second season were conceived, written and shot to air as the final five episodes of the first season, but aired during the 2005-2006 season due to the high number of viewers that watched \"Who's Zoomin' Who?\", the season's highest-rated episode with 22.22 million viewers tuning in.",

It was set in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, located in the city of Seattle, Washington.

Throughout the season, new story lines were introduced, including the love triangle between Meredith Grey, Derek Shepherd, and Addison Montgomery, the main arc of the season. Also heavily developed was the story line involving Izzie Stevens' relationship with patient Denny Duquette, which resulted in critical acclaim and positive fan response.",

Rhimes also claimed that Season 11 will pick up right where Season 10 left us, so there won\'t be much that the audience won\'t see. In another interview discussing this storyline, Rhimes revealed that she and the writers are thinking about doing flashback periods to the younger days of Drs. Ellis Grey and Richard Webber.',

      'Asta and Yuno were abandoned together at the same church, and have been inseparable since. As children, they promised that they would compete against each other to see who would become the next Emperor Magus. However, as they grew up, some differences between them became plain. Yuno was a genius with magic, with amazing power and control, while Asta could not use magic at all, and tried to make up for his lack by training physically. When they received their Grimoires at age 15, Yuno got a spectacular book with a four-leaf clover (most people receive a three-leaf-clover), while Asta received nothing at all. However, when Yuno was threatened, the truth about Asta\'s power was revealed, he received a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a "black clover"! Now the two friends are heading out in the world, both seeking the same goal!',

This was no longer a battle between warring factions; it was a fight for humanity itself. Now, a hard truth lands on the shoulders of those who remain.

The producers considered aborting the series if the next episode turned out as bad, but it only suffered from easily fixable problems. The producers convinced Fox to move the debut to December 17, and aired "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" as the first episode of the series. The first season won one Emmy Award, and received four additional nominations.\n\nThe DVD boxset was released on September 25, 2001 in Region 1 and September 24, 2001 in both Region 2 and Region 4.

Former showrunners Al Jean and Mike Reiss produced the remaining two; they produced the two episodes with the staff of The Critic, the show they left The Simpsons to create. This was done in order to relieve some of the stress The Simpsons' writing staff endured, as they felt that producing 25 in one season was too much. The episode \"A Star Is Burns\" caused some controversy among the staff with Matt Groening removing his name from the episode's credits as he saw it as blatant advertising for The Critic, which was airing at the time. Fox moved The Simpsons back to its original Sunday night time, having aired on Thursdays for the previous four seasons. It has remained in this slot ever since.

    overview:
      'Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by Titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest Titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a Titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a Colossal Titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller Titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single Titan and take revenge for all of mankind.',

The series is set in Los Angeles, California, and follows the stories of the members of the Office of Special Projects, an undercover division of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. The show and its characters were introduced during the sixth season episodes of NCIS titled "Legend" and "Legend". These episodes served as a backdoor pilot for the series.\n\nThe series\' first season was originally planned to have thirteen episodes. On October 7, 2009, after rating as the most watched new show of the Fall 2009 U.S. television season, CBS ordered a full set of 22 episodes, which was extended to 24 episodes on November 4, 2009.\n\nAlso, like the original NCIS show, the programme uses black and white images or rather proofs. However, instead of being just a three-second image, various black and white images demonstrating what will happen during the episode are displayed on screen. In the UK and Ireland, where NCIS: Los Angeles is shown, Sky have removed the images, presumably because they might cause seizures in people who have photosensitive epilepsy. This has since been expanded to the first four seasons of the show.',

      "Witchblade is an American television series that aired on TNT from 2001 to 2002. The series is based on the Witchblade comic book series, and followed a pilot film which debuted in August 2000. Some of the episodes were written by Ralph Hemecker, Marc Silvestri and J.D. Zeik.\n\nYancy Butler starred as Sara Pezzini, Anthony Cistaro as Kenneth Irons, David Chokachi as Jake McCartey, Eric Etebari as Ian Nottingham, Will Yun Lee as Danny Woo, Conrad Dunn as Tommy Gallo, Kenneth Welsh as Joe Siri, and John Hensley as Gabriel Bowman, among others. Although critically acclaimed and popular with audiences, the show was canceled in September 2002; there was speculation that the cancellation was connected to Butler's entering rehab for alcoholism.\n\nThe series ran for two seasons on TNT, for a total of 24 episodes. The first episode aired June 12, 2001; the last episode aired August 26, 2002. In spite of its cancellation, Witchblade was ranked seventh in the Top 10 Basic Cable Dramas for 2002.\n\nAccording to Top Cow editor Matt Hawkins the Witchblade TV series was cancelled because the lead actress Yancy Butler was an alcoholic and went into rehab – it was and remains the highest rated TV series to be cancelled.",

Now age 23, Jane is a driven young woman studying to become a teacher, nursing a dream to be a writer, and supporting herself with a job at a hot new Miami hotel. All the years of watching telenovelas with the two women who raised her – her sexy, young-at-heart mother, Xiomara, and her still-devout grandmother, Alba – have given Jane a slightly unrealistic view of romance. Still, she is determined not to make the same mistake her mother made – becoming an unwed mother at 16. Jane has managed to find a wonderful fiancé: a handsome, hard-working detective named Michael. All of Jane’s meticulous life plans are turned upside down, however, when she sees her doctor for a routine check-up and is accidentally artificially inseminated. Unbeknownst to her, the specimen belongs to Rafael, a reformed playboy and cancer survivor, who is not only the new owner of the hotel where Jane works but also a former summer crush of hers. Jane’s life has suddenly become as dramatic and complicated as the telenovelas she has always loved.',

Although Jane was engaged to her long-time love, Michael, the tension proved too much for the couple, and they called off their engagement... and Jane and Rafael began seeing each other. But happily ever after was interrupted by murder and mayhem, by scheming exes and maniacal criminal masterminds. Oh, and then there’s the fact that Jane learned her long lost father is Rogelio De La Vega, her favorite telenovela star! And now he’s back in her life... But amidst all the crazy, there are the Villaneuva women who band together to support each other always, no matter the twists and turns thrown their way.

And oh yeah, she was also in a much debated love triangle! Would Jane choose to be with Michael, the steadfast detective? Or Rafael, Mateo’s father? And at last Jane chose Michael! And the wedding planning began. Of course, no one was more thrilled than Jane’s telenovela star father Rogelio, who was #teammichael from the start. Oh, and speaking of Rogelio – he was in love with Jane’s mother, Xo. But alas, he wanted to have kids and she didn’t. So they broke up and he threw himself into his new telenovela… and into his new telenovela headwriter. Complicated right? And speaking of complicated – let’s talk Rafael. He found himself a father of three this season, after his ex-wife Petra inseminated herself with his last sperm sample. And they had twins! Plus, poor Rafael found out his mother was a crime lord. So yeah. Pretty heavy stuff. Also heavy… Rogelio threw Jane the wedding of her dreams. But then, in the final moments, Michael was shot. Which is where we left off…',

We pick our story up three years later and Jane’s life is certainly not what she planned. First of all, she’s a widow, like her Abuela. But she’s also channeled that grief into a book about her love story with Michael… And guess what? It was being published! Oh, and also on the bright side – Jane’s parents finally found their way back to each other and got engaged. And speaking of finding their way back to each other, Jane and Rafael are now the closest of friends. And it’s a good thing, because remember their cute, snuggly son Mateo? Well, he’s now quite the handful – to put it mildly. And to make matters worse – Rafael’s twins he had with Petra were frickin’ angels. Oh, and Petra was kicking butt professionally too. Business was booming at the Marbella until everyone’s (not) favorite employee Scott was found dead! I know, OMG, right? And soon, Petra and her twin sister Anezka were both suspects!

          'The first season of Dexter is an adaptation of Jeff Lindsay\'s first novel in the Dexter series, Darkly Dreaming Dexter. Subsequent seasons have featured original storylines. This season aired from October 1, 2006 to December 17, 2006, and follows Dexter\'s investigation of "The Ice Truck Killer". Introduced in the first episode, "Dexter", this serial killer targets prostitutes and leaves their bodies severed and bloodless. At the same time, Dexter\'s foster sister, Debra Morgan, a vice squad officer, aspires to work in the homicide department, and Dexter\'s girlfriend, Rita Bennett, wants their relationship to be more intimate. Christian Camargo appears as Rudy Cooper and is a recurring character until the end of the season.\n\nThe show\'s first season received generally favorable reviews from critics; it was praised as "bold, different and exciting, with a central character and performance that take your breath away" by the New York Daily News. The Wall Street Journal saw "the grotesqueries of Dexter" as "not something that can easily be dismissed with the old "you don\'t have to watch" line", and concluded that "We do have to live among the viewers who will be desensitized, or aroused, by this show". The aggregate site Metacritic scored the show\'s first season at 77 out of 100 based on 27 critics reviews.',

The season finale, "The British Invasion", attracted 1.4 million viewers, making it the program\'s most-watched episode until the airing of the season three finale, "Do You Take Dexter Morgan?". Including digital video recorder usage, season two was watched by an average of 2.4 million viewers on a weekly basis through 11 full weeks, outperforming season one by 21%. The season received universal acclaim from critics, and was praised as "one of the best shows on TV this decade" by the Chicago Sun-Times, while Variety considers Hall\'s portrayal of the title character as a "towering achievement, one that eclipses the show\'s other shortcomings and rough patches"; the aggregate site Metacritic scored the season at 85 out of 100 based on 11 reviews.\n\nIn the season, the bodies of Dexter\'s victims are uncovered and an investigation is launched in Dexter\'s own department to find the killer, dubbed the "Bay Harbor Butcher". During this time, Debra struggles to recover after surviving Ice Truck Killer\'s attempts to murder her, and Rita sends Dexter to Narcotics Anonymous meetings when she suspects that he has an addiction. Sergeant James Doakes, stalks Dexter, suspecting that he is connected with the "Ice Truck Killer" killings. Three new characters are introduced: Keith Carradine appears as Special Agent Frank Lundy, an FBI agent who heads the "Bay Harbor Butcher" investigation, JoBeth Williams as Rita\'s mother Gail, and Jaime Murray as Lila Tournay, Dexter\'s Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.',

The season\'s finale, "Do You Take Dexter Morgan?" attracted 1.5 million viewers. Season three was watched by an average of 1.1 million viewers a week. It received largely positive reviews from critics, which ranged from being praised as "truly and incredibly exciting television" in the San Francisco Chronicle, to "lack[ing] the crackling tension the drama had supplied in previous years" by the Chicago Tribune; the aggregate site Metacritic scored the season at 78 out of 100 based on 13 reviews. Smits and Hall received Emmy nominations for their roles as Miguel Prado and Dexter Morgan respectively, while the show as a whole also received a Best Drama Emmy nomination.\n\nIn this season, Dexter kills a man in self-defense and initiates a friendship with the man\'s brother, Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado. In the meantime, Rita discovers that she is pregnant, and Debra investigates the murders of a new serial killer, called "The Skinner", hoping to gain a promotion to detective. In addition to Smits, Dexter\'s third season introduces two recurring characters: Desmond Harrington as Det. Joey Quinn, who becomes Debra\'s partner when he is transferred from the narcotics department to homicide, and Anne Ramsay as Ellen Wolf, a defense attorney whom Miguel detests.',

So too are the strange Homunculi and their shadowy creator. The mythical gem lures exotic alchemists from distant kingdoms, scarring some deeply enough to inspire murder. As the Elrics find their course altered by these enemies and allies, their purpose remains unchanged – and their bond unbreakable.",

    overview:
      "Casualty, stylised as CASUAL+Y, is a British medical drama television series that airs weekly on BBC One, and the longest-running emergency medical drama television series in the world. Created by Jeremy Brock and Paul Unwin, it was first broadcast on 6 September 1986, and transmitted in the UK on BBC One. The original producer was Geraint Morris.\n\nThe programme is based around the fictional Holby City Hospital and focuses on the staff and patients of the hospital's Accident and Emergency Department. The show has very few ties to its sister programme Holby City which began as a spin off from Casualty in 1999 and is set in the same hospital, but upstairs. The show's plots and characters occasionally crossover between the two programmes, but this is rare, and each show can easily be followed without having to watch the other. Casualty is shown weekly on a Saturday evening, which has been its time slot since the early 1990s.",

Applications were due in January 11, 2011, approximately 800 applicants visited in various states, from there 18 contestants were chosen to participate. The season was filmed in the vicinity of Upolu, Samoa, which is the same filming location used for seasons 19, 20, and 23. \n\nThe two tribes were initially divided by gender, which was previously done in three other seasons. Two significant new twists debuted this season. Unlike previous seasons where tribes lived at separate camp sites, the two tribes began living on the same campsite together. While the concept of all the castaways living at the same camp prior to the merge also appeared in other seasons, this is the first time it was employed at the beginning of the game and continued beyond the first tribal challenge. Following the tribal swap on Day 12, both the gender-divided tribes and the "One World" twist were dissolved. The second twist involved the hidden immunity idols. There were three idols hidden, two were designated for a specific tribe. If a castaway found an idol designated for his or her tribe, the castaway could keep and use it; If a castaway found an idol designated for the opposing tribe, he or she was required to give it to a member of the other tribe before the next tribal council.',

Each group of 10 castaways possesses similar characteristics that represent their generation and help unify their tribe. Millennials, the largest living generational group and most diverse in U.S. history grew up in a time of rapid change and are often described as having priorities that are vastly different from previous generations. How will this group fare without technology on the island? Will they opt for shortcuts in challenges or go the distance? Generation X forms the bridge between the Baby Boomers and the Millennials and has been collectively labeled as hard-working and independent people. Will they be able to find some commonalities with the younger castaways or stick to their own group? Will their differences and preconceived beliefs be too much to overcome? This season's cast includes an assistant district attorney, a youth pastor, a police sergeant, a television writer, a professional gamer and the youngest player to ever compete in the game, a high school student.",
